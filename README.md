# Carbon: Rebuilt
## The better sequel to CarbonDF
### Made by GaMeNu

Hello! Welcome to Carbon: Rebuilt's GitHub page! This is a complete remake, from the ground up, of CarbonDF.

This project has a dual purpose, thus it is split to two parts: A Java intermediary and a parser.

The first part of the project aims to create a robust, consistent, and documented system to write and represent
DiamondFire code within Java. Once that part is completed, it will already be possible to write complete templates
within Java, using CarbonDF

The second part of the project will build upon the intermediary Java representation, and will consist of a Parser
(probably written in ANTLR), that will transpile text-based code files to the intermediary format.
